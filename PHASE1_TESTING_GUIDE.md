## BACKEND VERIFICATION

### Direct Backend API Testing (Optional)

**1. Get All Users:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "admin",
      "email": "admin@opticonnect.com",
      "full_name": "Admin User",
      "role": "admin",
      "is_active": true,
      "regions": "[\"Maharashtra\"]",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Create User:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "username": "curl_test",
    "email": "curltest@opticonnect.com",
    "password": "Test@123",
    "full_name": "Curl Test User",
    "role": "viewer",
    "department": "Test Dept",
    "is_active": true
  }'
```

**3. Update User:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/users/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "full_name": "Updated Name",
    "role": "manager"
  }'
```

**4. Delete User:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/users/5 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### Issue 1: "Failed to fetch users"
**Possible Causes:**
- Backend not running
- CORS error
- Wrong API URL in .env
- Authentication token missing/expired

**Fix:**
1. Check backend is running: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
2. Check frontend .env: `REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api`
3. Check backend .env: `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001`
4. Re-login to refresh token

---

### Issue 2: CORS Error
**Symptoms:** Console shows "Access to fetch... has been blocked by CORS policy"

**Fix:**
1. Check backend .env has correct FRONTEND_URL
2. Restart backend server after changing .env
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
4. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

---

### Issue 3: "User already exists"
**Symptoms:** Can't create user with certain email/username

**Cause:** User with that email/username exists in database

**Fix:**
1. Use different email/username, OR
2. Delete existing user first, OR
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'x@y.com'`

---

### Issue 4: Users Load from Mock Data
**Symptoms:** See mock users (Rajesh Kumar, Priya Sharma, Amit Singh)

**Cause:** Backend request failed, fallback to mock data

**Fix:**
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify backend is running
3. Check Network tab for failed requests
4. Fix backend connection issue
5. Click Retry button

---

### Issue 5: TypeScript Errors
**Symptoms:** Build fails with TypeScript errors in userService.ts

**Common Errors:**
- `Property 'regions' does not exist` â†’ Backend might return `regions` as array, not string
- `Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'` â†’ ID transformation issue

**Fix:**
1. Check backend response format in Network tab
2. Update transformation functions if backend schema changed
3. Add console.log in transformBackendUser() to debug

---

## DEBUGGING TIPS

**Enable Detailed Logging:**
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for these logs:
   - `ðŸ”„ Loading data...`
   - `âœ… Total entries loaded: X`
   - `Error fetching users: ...`

**Check Network Requests:**
1. Open DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Filter by "users"
3. Check request/response for each operation
4. Look for failed requests (red)
5. Inspect request payload and response data

**Database Inspection:**
```sql
-- See all users
SELECT * FROM users;

-- See recent users
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- See inactive users
SELECT * FROM users WHERE is_active = 0;

-- Count users by role
SELECT role, COUNT(*) FROM users GROUP BY role;
```

**Backend Logs:**
Check backend terminal for logs showing:
- Incoming requests
- Database queries
- Errors/warnings
- Success messages

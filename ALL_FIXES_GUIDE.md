## üö® Issue 1: CORS Error (MOST URGENT - Fix This First!)

### Error Message:
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://localhost:3002' 
that is not equal to the supplied origin 'http://localhost:3005'
```

### Problem:
Backend server is still running with OLD configuration (port 3002) but we changed it to 3005.

### Solution: RESTART THE BACKEND

```bash
# Stop the current backend process
# Press Ctrl+C in the backend terminal

# Then restart
cd OptiConnect_Backend
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üîí CORS Enabled: http://localhost:3005  ‚Üê Should show 3005, not 3002
```

**If backend won't stop:**
```bash
# Windows - Find and kill the process
netstat -ano | findstr :5005
taskkill /F /PID [process_id]

# Then start again
cd OptiConnect_Backend
npm start
```

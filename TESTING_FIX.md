# Testing the Temporary Region Expiry Fix

## 🐛 Problem Identified

The issue was that **Assam** was showing in "Permanent Access (3)" section even though it was granted as temporary access. This happened because:

1. When temporary access is granted, the region is added to BOTH:
   - `temporary_access` table (with expiry time)
   - `user_regions` table (for actual access)

2. When the temporary access expired, it was only checked in `temporary_access` table
3. The `user_regions` table still contained the entry, making it appear as "permanent"

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Modified the `getCurrentValidRegions()` function to:

1. **Track which regions ever had temporary access**
2. **Check which temporary access is currently active (non-expired)**
3. **Filter logic:**
   - If region ever had temporary access → only show if currently active
   - If region never had temporary access → it's truly permanent, always show

## 🧪 How to Test

### Step 1: Restart Backend

```bash
cd OptiConnect_Backend
npm start
```

**Wait for:** `🔥 Server is ready to accept requests!`

### Step 2: Keep Frontend Running

If frontend is already running on port 3005, keep it. Otherwise:

```bash
cd OptiConnect_Frontend
npm start
```

### Step 3: Test Expired Region Removal

**Current Situation:**
- User has "Assam" showing in Permanent Access
- But Assam was granted as temporary (probably already expired)

**What Will Happen:**
1. Within 30 seconds (next monitor check), the frontend will call `/api/temporary-access/current-regions`
2. Backend will recognize that Assam had temporary access but it's expired
3. Assam will be filtered out from the response
4. Frontend will update Redux state
5. **Assam will disappear from the map and profile!** ✨

### Step 4: Watch the Console

**Browser Console (F12):**
After ~30 seconds, you should see:
```
🔄 Temporary region access has changed
   Previous regions: ["Jammu and Kashmir", "Ladakh", "Assam"]
   Current valid regions: ["Jammu and Kashmir", "Ladakh"]
⏰ Your temporary region access has expired
```

**Profile Should Now Show:**
```
Permanent Access (2)  ← Changed from 3 to 2!
• Jammu and Kashmir
• Ladakh
```

### Step 5: Test Fresh Temporary Access

1. **Admin grants new temporary access:**
   - Select "Assam" region
   - Set expiry: **2 minutes** from now
   - Click Grant

2. **User sees Assam immediately** (no re-login needed)
   - Profile shows: "Permanent Access (3)"
   - Assam appears on map

3. **Wait 2+ minutes**
   - After next monitor check (~30 seconds after expiry)
   - Assam disappears automatically
   - Profile shows: "Permanent Access (2)"
   - **No re-login needed!**

## 📊 Backend Logging

Watch backend console for debugging:

```bash
# When user opens the app
GET /api/temporary-access/current-regions 200

# Backend logic (you can add console.logs to see):
# 1. Checking regions that ever had temp access
# 2. Checking which temp access is currently active
# 3. Filtering expired ones
```

## 🔍 Verify in Database

You can verify the logic in MySQL:

```sql
-- Check temporary access records
SELECT 
    ta.id,
    u.username,
    r.name as region,
    ta.expires_at,
    ta.revoked_at,
    CASE
        WHEN ta.expires_at > UTC_TIMESTAMP() AND ta.revoked_at IS NULL THEN 'ACTIVE'
        WHEN ta.expires_at <= UTC_TIMESTAMP() THEN 'EXPIRED'
        WHEN ta.revoked_at IS NOT NULL THEN 'REVOKED'
    END as status
FROM temporary_access ta
JOIN users u ON ta.user_id = u.id
JOIN regions r ON ta.resource_id = r.id
WHERE u.username = 'HIMIL CHAUHAN'
ORDER BY ta.granted_at DESC;

-- Check user_regions (what's currently accessible)
SELECT 
    u.username,
    r.name as region,
    ur.access_level
FROM user_regions ur
JOIN users u ON ur.user_id = u.id
JOIN regions r ON ur.region_id = r.id
WHERE u.username = 'HIMIL CHAUHAN';
```

## ✅ Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- Expired temporary regions showed as "Permanent"
- User had to re-login to see changes

### After Fix:
- Expired temporary regions automatically hidden
- Real-time updates (within 30 seconds)
- No re-login required
- Truly permanent regions unaffected

## 🎯 Success Criteria

✅ Assam disappears within 30 seconds (without re-login)
✅ Profile shows correct count: "Permanent Access (2)"
✅ New temporary access works correctly
✅ Temporary regions expire automatically
✅ Permanent regions ("Jammu and Kashmir", "Ladakh") remain visible

## 🐛 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Backend Restarted?
Make sure you restarted the backend after the code changes.

### Check 2: Monitor Running?
Browser console should show:
```
✅ Temporary region monitor started (checking every 30s)
```

### Check 3: API Response
Check Network tab (F12) → Look for calls to:
```
/api/temporary-access/current-regions
```

Response should only include regions with:
- Active temporary access OR
- Never had temporary access (truly permanent)

### Check 4: Time Issues
Make sure your server time is correct (UTC). Check:
```bash
# In backend console, you should see:
🕐 Current server time (UTC): 2025-10-13T11:45:00.000Z
```

---

**The fix is now deployed! Just restart the backend and wait ~30 seconds to see Assam disappear!** ✨
